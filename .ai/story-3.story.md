# Story 3: Implement In-Memory Caching Layer

## Story

**As a** system architect\
**I want** to implement an in-memory caching layer for rules\
**so that** we can achieve sub-millisecond access times for frequently accessed rules.

## Status

Complete

## Context

With our persistent storage layer in place, we now need to implement an in-memory caching mechanism to further improve performance. The caching layer will sit between our API endpoints and the persistent storage, providing rapid access to frequently requested rules while maintaining data consistency. This implementation will help us meet our performance goals of sub-millisecond response times for cached rules.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2 (approximately 20 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Implement in-memory caching mechanism using Node.js native Map
2. - [x] Develop cache management strategies (TTL, LRU, size limits)
3. - [x] Ensure cache consistency with persistent storage
4. - [x] Implement cache invalidation and update mechanisms
5. - [x] Add cache hit/miss metrics and monitoring
6. - [x] Achieve sub-millisecond response times for cached rules
7. - [x] Maintain thread safety for concurrent operations
8. - [x] Add comprehensive tests for cache operations

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Cache Implementation
   1. - [x] Select and implement caching mechanism (Node.js Map)
   2. - [x] Define cache key structure
   3. - [x] Implement cache get/set operations
2. - [x] Cache Management
   1. - [x] Implement TTL and LRU eviction
   2. - [x] Add cache size monitoring
   3. - [x] Implement cache warm-up strategy
3. - [x] Cache Consistency
   1. - [x] Implement write-through caching
   2. - [x] Add cache invalidation triggers
   3. - [x] Handle concurrent modifications
4. - [x] Testing & Monitoring
   1. - [x] Write unit tests for cache operations
   2. - [x] Implement cache metrics collection
   3. - [x] Add performance benchmarks
   4. - [x] Write integration tests

## Constraints

- Must achieve sub-millisecond response times for cached rules
- Must maintain consistency with persistent storage
- Must handle concurrent operations safely
- Must include monitoring and metrics
- Must achieve 80% test coverage minimum

## Dev Notes

- Used Node.js Map for simple in-memory caching
- Implemented proper error handling for cache operations
- Added memory usage monitoring through cache size limits
- Implemented concurrent operation safety using a lock mechanism
- Added comprehensive test suite with 80% branch coverage
- Validated constructor parameters to prevent invalid configurations

## Progress Notes As Needed

1. Implemented basic cache operations with Map
2. Added TTL and size-based eviction
3. Implemented metrics tracking
4. Added concurrent operation safety with locks
5. Created comprehensive test suite
6. Fixed branch coverage issues
7. Added constructor validation
8. All tests passing with required coverage
