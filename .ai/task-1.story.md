# Task 1: Fix Test Suite and Build Configuration Issues

## Story

**As a** development team member\
**I want** to resolve all test suite failures and build configuration issues\
**so that** we can maintain a stable and reliable codebase with proper TypeScript configuration.

## Status

Complete

## Context

Recent test execution and build process analysis revealed several critical issues that need to be addressed:

1. Test suite failures due to incomplete Rule interface implementation
2. TypeScript configuration issues with test directory structure
3. Code coverage gaps in certain modules
4. Memory leaks and improper test teardown
5. Build process failing due to rootDir configuration

## Estimation

Story Points: 2 (20 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Fix Rule Interface Implementation
   - [x] Add missing properties (name, createdAt, updatedAt)
   - [x] Update all test files using Rule interface
   - [x] Ensure type consistency across the codebase
2. - [x] Resolve TypeScript Configuration
   - [x] Fix rootDir configuration in tsconfig.json
   - [x] Properly separate test and source configurations
   - [x] Ensure clean build process
3. - [x] Improve Test Coverage
   - [x] Increase sources.ts coverage to >85%
   - [x] Add missing edge case tests
   - [x] Implement proper test teardown procedures
4. - [x] Fix Memory Leaks
   - [x] Identify and fix timer-related issues
   - [x] Implement proper resource cleanup
   - [x] Add teardown procedures in test suites

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Rule Interface Updates

   1. - [x] Update src/types/rule.ts with complete interface
   2. - [x] Update test/database.test.ts rule objects
   3. - [x] Update test/database.integration.test.ts rule objects
   4. - [x] Verify type consistency in all files

2. - [x] TypeScript Configuration

   1. - [x] Create separate tsconfig.test.json for test files
   2. - [x] Update build scripts in package.json
   3. - [x] Verify build process with new configuration
   4. - [x] Update CI/CD pipeline if necessary

3. - [x] Test Coverage Improvements

   1. - [x] Add tests for sources.ts error conditions
   2. - [x] Implement missing edge cases in database manager
   3. - [x] Add integration tests for complex scenarios
   4. - [x] Verify coverage meets targets

4. - [x] Memory Leak Resolution
   1. - [x] Add proper teardown in test suites
   2. - [x] Review and fix timer usage
   3. - [x] Implement resource cleanup procedures
   4. - [x] Verify with --detectOpenHandles flag

## Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- Test coverage must meet or exceed 85% across all metrics
- Build process must complete without errors
- All tests must pass without memory leaks
- Must follow TypeScript best practices

## Dev Notes

### Current Issues Summary

1. **Test Failures**: RESOLVED

   - Added missing Rule interface properties
   - Updated test objects with complete properties
   - Fixed memory leaks in test suites

2. **Build Issues**: RESOLVED

   - Fixed rootDir configuration
   - Separated test and source configs
   - Clean build process working

3. **Coverage Gaps**: RESOLVED
   - sources.ts: Increased to 96% statements
   - Achieved >85% branch coverage across all files

### Solutions Implemented

1. **TypeScript Configuration**:

   - Created separate test config (tsconfig.test.json)
   - Fixed rootDir setup
   - Established clear build paths

2. **Test Improvements**:

   - Completed Rule interface implementation
   - Added proper test cleanup
   - Implemented comprehensive edge case coverage

3. **Build Process**:
   - Updated npm scripts
   - Separated test and source builds
   - Organized file structure properly

## Progress Notes

1. ✅ Rule Interface Updates - COMPLETED

   - Updated all test objects with required Rule interface properties
   - All test suites now passing
   - Type consistency achieved across the codebase

2. ✅ TypeScript Configuration - COMPLETED

   - Created separate tsconfig.test.json for tests
   - Updated build scripts in package.json
   - Both source and test builds working correctly

3. ✅ Test Coverage Improvements - COMPLETED

   - Increased sources.ts coverage to 96%
   - Added comprehensive test suite with edge cases
   - Implemented proper test isolation and cleanup

4. ✅ Memory Leak Resolution - COMPLETED
   - Fixed file watcher cleanup in sources.ts
   - Implemented proper async cleanup in tests
   - All tests now passing with --detectOpenHandles flag
   - Achieved clean test execution with proper resource management

Final Status: All objectives completed successfully. The codebase now has:

- Clean TypeScript configuration
- Complete test coverage (>85% across all metrics)
- Proper resource cleanup and memory management
- Stable and reliable test execution
