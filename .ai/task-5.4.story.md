# Task 5.4: Resource Monitoring Implementation

## Story

**As a** system administrator\
**I want** to monitor system resource utilization\
**so that** I can ensure the MCP server operates within acceptable resource limits.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This task implements resource monitoring capabilities to track system resource utilization including memory, CPU, disk I/O, and network usage. This will help identify potential bottlenecks and ensure optimal server performance.

## Estimation

Task Points: 0.5 (approximately 5 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] Add memory monitoring
   - [ ] Track heap usage
   - [ ] Monitor garbage collection
   - [ ] Set memory thresholds
2. - [ ] Implement CPU tracking
   - [ ] Monitor CPU usage
   - [ ] Track process metrics
   - [ ] Set CPU thresholds
3. - [ ] Add I/O monitoring
   - [ ] Track disk operations
   - [ ] Monitor network I/O
   - [ ] Set I/O thresholds
4. - [ ] Create alerts
   - [ ] Implement alert system
   - [ ] Add notification channels
   - [ ] Create alert rules

## Technical Details

1. Resource Monitor Implementation:

   ```typescript
   interface ResourceMetrics {
     memory: MemoryMetrics;
     cpu: CpuMetrics;
     io: IoMetrics;
     network: NetworkMetrics;
   }

   interface ResourceMonitor {
     collectMetrics(): Promise<ResourceMetrics>;
     setThresholds(thresholds: ResourceThresholds): void;
     configureAlerts(config: AlertConfig): void;
   }
   ```

2. Required Dependencies:
   - node-os-utils
   - systeminformation
   - @types/node-os-utils

## Test Cases

1. Memory Monitoring

   - Should track heap usage accurately
   - Should monitor GC events
   - Should detect memory leaks

2. CPU Monitoring

   - Should track CPU usage
   - Should monitor process metrics
   - Should handle multi-core systems

3. I/O Monitoring

   - Should track disk operations
   - Should monitor network I/O
   - Should measure throughput

4. Alerting
   - Should trigger alerts correctly
   - Should send notifications
   - Should handle alert conditions

## Constraints

- Must have minimal performance impact
- Must handle system-specific differences
- Must follow TypeScript best practices
- Must achieve 80% test coverage
- Must use proper error handling

## Dev Notes

Implementation will follow TDD approach:

1. Write tests for resource monitoring
2. Implement metrics collection
3. Add threshold monitoring
4. Create alert system
5. Validate accuracy
