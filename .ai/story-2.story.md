# Story 2: Implement Persistent Storage Layer

## Story

**As a** system architect\
**I want** to implement a persistent storage layer for rules\
**so that** we can maintain rule data between server restarts and reduce dependency on remote git repositories.

## Status

Complete

## Context

Following the successful setup of our basic server structure, we need to implement a persistent storage layer to cache rules and reduce the dependency on remote git repositories. This is a critical component of our architecture that will improve performance and reliability. We will use SQLite as our storage solution due to its lightweight nature and ease of setup, making it perfect for our embedded use case.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2 (approximately 20 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] SQLite database is properly initialized with appropriate tables for storing rules
2. - [x] CRUD operations for rules are implemented with proper error handling
3. - [x] Database schema includes all necessary fields from rule headers (name, type, description, tags, priority)
4. - [x] Integration tests demonstrate successful persistence between server restarts
5. - [x] Performance metrics show sub-100ms response times for basic CRUD operations

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Database Setup
   1. - [x] Create database initialization script
   2. - [x] Define rule table schema
   3. - [x] Implement database connection manager
2. - [x] Rule Storage Operations
   1. - [x] Implement create/insert operation
   2. - [x] Implement read/query operations
   3. - [x] Implement update operation
   4. - [x] Implement delete operation
3. - [x] Testing & Validation
   1. - [x] Write unit tests for database operations
   2. - [x] Write integration tests for persistence
   3. - [x] Implement performance benchmarks

## Constraints

- Must use SQLite for persistent storage
- Must maintain type safety throughout the implementation
- Must follow the established TypeScript coding standards
- Must achieve 80% test coverage minimum

## Dev Notes

- We will use the `better-sqlite3` package for TypeScript compatibility and performance
- Schema will need to accommodate both structured header data and rule content
- Consider implementing prepared statements for better performance and security

## Progress Notes As Needed

1. Implemented initial test suite following TDD principles
2. Created Rule type interface with comprehensive documentation
3. Implemented DatabaseManager with SQLite integration:
   - Table creation and schema management
   - CRUD operations for rules
   - Support for filtering by type and tags
   - Proper error handling and type safety
4. Added better-sqlite3 dependency and type definitions
5. Implemented comprehensive integration tests:
   - Verified persistence between server restarts
   - Tested data integrity with multiple restarts
   - Validated concurrent operations
   - Confirmed performance meets sub-100ms requirement
   - Added edge case handling for optional fields
   - Improved tag filtering with proper JSON handling
