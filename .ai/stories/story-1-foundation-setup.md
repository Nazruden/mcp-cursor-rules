# Story 1: Foundation Setup

## Story

**As a** developer\
**I want** to set up the basic FastMCP server with TypeScript configuration, initial tool implementation, and PostgreSQL integration\
**so that** we have a working foundation for the MCP-based rule management system.

## Status

Complete

## Context

We need to establish the foundational components of our MCP server using the FastMCP framework with TypeScript. This includes setting up the basic server structure, implementing initial MCP tools for rule management (including the critical smart_fetch tool), and integrating PostgreSQL as our database layer. This story represents the first phase of development and will provide the base infrastructure for subsequent features.

## Estimation

Story Points: 4 (4 days of human development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] FastMCP server is set up and running with TypeScript configuration
2. - [x] Basic MCP tool interfaces are implemented (smart_fetch)
3. - [x] PostgreSQL integration is complete
4. - [x] Basic error handling is implemented
5. - [x] Project structure follows FastMCP conventions
6. - [x] Basic tests are written and passing
7. - [x] smart_fetch tool is working with basic relevance scoring
8. - [x] Test coverage meets minimum requirements (80%)

## Progress Notes

### 2024-02-24

- Set up project structure with TypeScript configuration
- Implemented PostgreSQL database service with proper schema
- Created smart_fetch tool with tag-based relevance scoring
- Added comprehensive test suite with Jest
- Set up proper error handling and input validation
- Created documentation and setup instructions

### 2024-02-25

- Fixed relevance scoring in smart_fetch tool

## Constraints

- Must use FastMCP framework
- Must use TypeScript
- Must follow MCP tool schema specifications
- Must use PostgreSQL
- All tests must be isolated and independent
- Unit tests must use mocks for external dependencies

## Dev Notes

- Reference FastMCP documentation for best practices
- Follow MCP tool schema for parameter definitions
- Implement proper error handling from the start
- Consider using TF-IDF or similar algorithms for relevance scoring in smart_fetch
- Document smart_fetch's scoring algorithm thoroughly
- Use Jest's mocking capabilities for dependency isolation
- Follow BDD style for test writing
- Use TypeScript decorators for FastMCP tools

## Testing Notes

- Unit Tests:

  ```typescript
  describe("smart_fetch", () => {
    let testDb: TestContainer;

    beforeAll(async () => {
      testDb = await initializeTestPostgres();
    });

    afterAll(async () => {
      await testDb.stop();
    });

    beforeEach(() => {
      // Set up test data
    });

    it("should return one .cursorrules file", async () => {
      const tags = ["typescript", "testing"];
      const result = await smartFetch(tags);
      expect(result.cursorrules).toBeDefined();
    });

    it("should score rules correctly", async () => {
      // Test relevance scoring
    });
  });
  ```

- Integration Tests:

  ```typescript
  describe("smart_fetch integration", () => {
    let postgres: TestContainer;

    beforeAll(async () => {
      postgres = await initializeTestPostgres();
      await setupTestData(postgres);
    });

    afterAll(async () => {
      await postgres.stop();
    });

    it("should interact with database correctly", async () => {
      // Test database interactions
    });
  });
  ```
