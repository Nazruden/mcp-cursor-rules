# Story 4: Production Ready

## Story

**As a** developer\
**I want** to optimize performance, complete documentation, and ensure comprehensive testing\
**so that** the server is ready for production deployment.

## Status

Draft

## Constraints

- Must achieve >80% test coverage
- Must include deployment documentation
- Must optimize PostgreSQL for production
- All tests must pass in production environment
- Load tests must simulate real-world scenarios
- Database performance must meet SLA requirements

## Dev Notes

- Focus on query performance optimization
- Document all configuration options
- Include monitoring guidelines
- Use Jest's coverage reporting
- Implement comprehensive test fixtures
- Use connection pooling effectively

## Testing Notes

- Production Environment Tests:

  ```typescript
  describe("PostgreSQL Performance", () => {
    beforeAll(async () => {
      await setupProductionDb();
    });

    it("should handle concurrent connections efficiently", async () => {
      const pool = createConnectionPool({
        max: 100,
        min: 5,
      });

      const connections = Array(100)
        .fill()
        .map(() => pool.connect());

      await expect(Promise.all(connections)).resolves.toBeDefined();

      const queryResults = await Promise.all(
        connections.map((conn) =>
          conn.query("SELECT * FROM rules WHERE tags @> $1", [["performance"]])
        )
      );

      expect(queryResults).toHaveLength(100);
    });

    it("should maintain ACID properties under load", async () => {
      await testTransaction(async (trx) => {
        await updateRule(ruleId, newContent, trx);
        throw new Error("Rollback");
      });

      const rule = await findRule(ruleId);
      expect(rule).toEqual(originalContent);
    });
  });
  ```

- Query Performance Tests:

  ```typescript
  describe("Query Optimization", () => {
    it("should use indexes effectively", async () => {
      const queryPlan = await explainQuery(
        "SELECT * FROM rules WHERE tags @> $1",
        [["performance"]]
      );

      expect(queryPlan).toContain("Index Scan");
      expect(queryPlan.executionTime).toBeLessThan(50);
    });

    it("should handle complex rule compositions efficiently", async () => {
      const start = performance.now();

      await composeRules(["rule1", "rule2", "rule3"], {
        resolveConflicts: true,
        validateComposition: true,
      });

      const duration = performance.now() - start;
      expect(duration).toBeLessThan(200);
    });
  });
  ```

- Load Tests:

  ```typescript
  describe("Production Load Testing", () => {
    it("should handle sustained load with optimized queries", async () => {
      const metrics = await runLoadTest({
        users: 1000,
        duration: "1h",
        rampUp: "5m",
        scenarios: ["ruleComposition", "smartFetch", "bulkOperations"],
      });

      expect(metrics.responseTime.p95).toBeLessThan(200);
      expect(metrics.errorRate).toBeLessThan(0.01);
      expect(metrics.dbConnections.max).toBeLessThan(100);
    });

    it("should recover from peak load with connection pooling", async () => {
      await simulatePeakLoad();
      const recovery = await measureRecoveryTime();
      expect(recovery).toBeLessThan(30000); // 30s

      const poolMetrics = await getConnectionPoolMetrics();
      expect(poolMetrics.overloadCount).toBe(0);
    });
  });
  ```
