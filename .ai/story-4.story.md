# Story 4: Implement Advanced Rule Management Features

## Story

**As a** system user\
**I want** to have advanced rule management capabilities including composition and filtering\
**so that** I can efficiently combine and filter rules based on specific criteria while maintaining MCP protocol compliance.

## Status

In Progress

## Context

With our core infrastructure in place (REST endpoints, persistent storage, and caching), we now need to implement advanced rule management features following MCP protocol specifications. This includes the ability to compose multiple rules into a single configuration and implement sophisticated filtering mechanisms based on tags, domains, and other metadata. These features are essential for providing a flexible and powerful rule management system that can adapt to various use cases while maintaining compatibility with MCP clients.
