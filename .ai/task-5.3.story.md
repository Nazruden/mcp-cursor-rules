# Task 5.3: Load Testing Implementation

## Story

**As a** system administrator\
**I want** to implement comprehensive load testing capabilities\
**so that** I can verify the MCP server's performance under various load conditions.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This task implements load testing capabilities to ensure the MCP server maintains performance and reliability under various load conditions. This includes creating benchmark scenarios, testing concurrent operations, and validating MCP protocol compliance under load.

## Estimation

Task Points: 0.5 (approximately 5 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Create benchmark suite
   - [x] Define benchmark scenarios
   - [x] Implement load generators
   - [x] Add result collection
2. - [x] Implement load tests
   - [x] Add concurrent request tests
   - [x] Test rule composition load
   - [x] Test cache performance
3. - [x] Add performance baselines
   - [x] Define performance targets
   - [x] Create baseline measurements
   - [x] Implement comparison logic
4. - [x] Create test reports
   - [x] Generate performance reports
   - [x] Add trend analysis
   - [x] Create visualization

## Technical Details

1. Load Testing Implementation:

   ```typescript
   interface LoadTest {
     name: string;
     duration: number;
     concurrency: number;
     scenario: LoadScenario;
     assertions: LoadAssertion[];
   }

   interface LoadTestRunner {
     run(test: LoadTest): Promise<LoadTestResult>;
     compareWithBaseline(result: LoadTestResult): ComparisonResult;
     generateReport(result: LoadTestResult): Report;
   }
   ```

2. Required Dependencies:
   - autocannon (for load testing) ✓
   - chart.js (for visualizations) ✓
   - @types/autocannon ✓

## Test Cases

1. Load Generation

   - [x] Should generate consistent load
   - [x] Should maintain request patterns
   - [x] Should collect accurate metrics

2. Concurrent Testing

   - [x] Should handle multiple users
   - [x] Should maintain data consistency
   - [x] Should measure latency accurately

3. Reporting
   - [x] Should generate detailed reports
   - [x] Should identify performance issues
   - [x] Should track trends over time

## Constraints

- Must not impact production systems ✓
- Must generate realistic load patterns ✓
- Must follow TypeScript best practices ✓
- Must achieve 80% test coverage ✓
- Must use proper error handling ✓

## Dev Notes

Implementation completed following TDD approach:

1. ✓ Write tests for load testing framework
2. ✓ Implement load generators using autocannon
3. ✓ Add result collection with detailed metrics
4. ✓ Create reporting system with recommendations
5. ✓ Validate accuracy with baseline comparisons

## Progress Notes

1. Created LoadTestService with comprehensive metrics collection
2. Implemented autocannon integration for load generation
3. Added baseline comparison functionality
4. Created detailed reporting with recommendations
5. All test cases passing with proper error handling
6. Added additional test coverage:
   - Error handling for scenario creation
   - Different HTTP methods and payload handling
   - Edge cases in baseline comparison
   - Report generation edge cases
7. Achieved coverage targets:
   - Statement coverage: 85%+
   - Branch coverage: 70%+
