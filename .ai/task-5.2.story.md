# Task 5.2: Cache Optimization

## Story

**As a** system administrator\
**I want** to optimize the caching strategy\
**so that** the MCP server can handle rule requests more efficiently with minimal latency.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This task focuses on optimizing the caching layer to improve performance and reduce latency. This includes implementing intelligent preloading, cache warming, and efficient eviction policies.

## Estimation

Task Points: 0.5 (approximately 5 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] Implement cache preloading
   - [ ] Add startup cache population
   - [ ] Implement background refresh
   - [ ] Add priority-based loading
2. - [ ] Add cache warming
   - [ ] Implement predictive loading
   - [ ] Add usage-based warming
   - [ ] Create warming strategies
3. - [ ] Optimize eviction policies
   - [ ] Implement LRU with weights
   - [ ] Add priority-based retention
   - [ ] Create custom eviction rules
4. - [ ] Add compression
   - [ ] Implement rule compression
   - [ ] Add selective compression
   - [ ] Optimize compression ratio

## Technical Details

1. Cache Implementation:

   ```typescript
   interface CacheConfig {
     maxSize: number;
     compressionThreshold: number;
     preloadPatterns: string[];
     warmingStrategy: WarmingStrategy;
     evictionPolicy: EvictionPolicy;
   }

   interface CacheManager {
     preload(): Promise<void>;
     warm(patterns: string[]): Promise<void>;
     compress(key: string): Promise<void>;
     optimize(): Promise<void>;
   }
   ```

2. Required Dependencies:
   - lru-cache
   - snappy (for compression)
   - @types/lru-cache

## Test Cases

1. Preloading

   - Should preload cache on startup
   - Should refresh cache in background
   - Should handle preload failures

2. Cache Warming

   - Should warm cache based on usage
   - Should predict needed entries
   - Should maintain performance during warming

3. Eviction

   - Should evict least used entries first
   - Should respect priority settings
   - Should handle memory pressure

4. Compression
   - Should compress large rules
   - Should maintain fast access times
   - Should optimize compression ratio

## Constraints

- Must maintain sub-millisecond access times
- Must handle concurrent access
- Must follow TypeScript best practices
- Must achieve 80% test coverage
- Must use proper error handling

## Dev Notes

Implementation will follow TDD approach:

1. Write tests for cache optimization
2. Implement preloading
3. Add warming strategies
4. Optimize eviction
5. Add compression support
