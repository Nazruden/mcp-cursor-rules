# Task 5.2: Cache Optimization

## Story

**As a** system administrator
**I want** to optimize the caching strategy
**so that** the MCP server can handle rule requests more efficiently with minimal latency.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This task focuses on optimizing the caching layer to improve performance and reduce latency. This includes implementing intelligent preloading, cache warming, and efficient eviction policies.

## Estimation

Task Points: 0.5 (approximately 5 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Implement cache preloading
   - [x] Add startup cache population
   - [x] Implement background refresh
   - [x] Add priority-based loading
2. - [x] Add cache warming
   - [x] Implement predictive loading
   - [x] Add usage-based warming
   - [x] Create warming strategies
3. - [x] Optimize eviction policies
   - [x] Implement LRU with weights
   - [x] Add priority-based retention
   - [x] Create custom eviction rules
4. - [x] Add compression
   - [x] Implement rule compression
   - [x] Add selective compression
   - [x] Optimize compression ratio

## Technical Details

1. Cache Implementation:

   ```typescript
   interface CacheConfig {
     maxSize: number;
     compressionThreshold: number;
     preloadPatterns: string[];
     warmingStrategy: WarmingStrategy;
     evictionPolicy: EvictionPolicy;
   }

   interface CacheManager {
     preload(): Promise<void>;
     warm(patterns: string[]): Promise<void>;
     compress(key: string): Promise<void>;
     optimize(): Promise<void>;
   }
   ```

2. Required Dependencies:

   - ✅ lru-cache
   - ✅ zlib (Node.js built-in)
   - ✅ @types/node

## Test Cases

1. Preloading

   - ✅ Should preload cache on startup
   - ✅ Should refresh cache in background
   - ✅ Should handle preload failures

2. Cache Warming

   - ✅ Should warm cache based on usage
   - ✅ Should predict needed entries
   - ✅ Should maintain performance during warming

3. Eviction

   - ✅ Should evict least used entries first
   - ✅ Should respect priority settings
   - ✅ Should handle memory pressure

4. Compression

   - ✅ Should compress large rules
   - ✅ Should maintain fast access times
   - ✅ Should optimize compression ratio

## Constraints

- ✅ Maintained sub-millisecond access times
- ✅ Handles concurrent access
- ✅ Follows TypeScript best practices
- ✅ Achieved >90% test coverage
- ✅ Uses proper error handling

## Dev Notes

Implementation followed TDD approach:

1. ✅ Write tests for cache optimization
2. ✅ Implement preloading
3. ✅ Add warming strategies
4. ✅ Optimize eviction
5. ✅ Add compression support

## Progress Notes

- Implemented comprehensive cache optimization features:
  - Added preloading with pattern support
  - Implemented usage-based and priority-based cache warming
  - Added hybrid eviction policy combining LRU, LFU, and priority
  - Implemented compression for large rules
- Achieved >90% test coverage with comprehensive test suite
- All features are properly documented and type-safe
- Successfully handles concurrent operations with proper locking
- Maintains performance with sub-millisecond access times
