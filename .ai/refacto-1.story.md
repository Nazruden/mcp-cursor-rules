# Story 1: FastMCP Framework Integration

## Story

**As a** developer\
**I want** to integrate the FastMCP framework into our cursor-rules server\
**so that** we can provide a standardized, efficient MCP interface for our rules management system.

## Status

In Progress

## Context

Our current cursor-rules server needs to be adapted to follow MCP standards more closely. FastMCP provides a robust framework for implementing MCP servers with minimal boilerplate. This refactoring will convert our existing Express-based implementation to use FastMCP's decorators and tools while maintaining our current functionality.

The integration will simplify our codebase, provide better type safety, and make it easier for clients to interact with our server through standardized MCP interfaces. We'll support both stdio (default) and SSE transports to accommodate different client needs.

## Estimation

Story Points: 3 (3 days of development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] Server successfully starts using FastMCP framework
2. - [ ] All existing functionality is preserved through MCP resources and tools
3. - [ ] Integration tests pass with the new implementation
4. - [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the new MCP-based architecture
5. - [ ] Package is publishable as an MCP server module
6. - [ ] Both stdio and SSE transports are supported and tested

## Subtasks

1. - [ ] Core MCP Server Setup (refacto-task-1.1.md)

   1. - [x] Set up FastMCP base class
   2. - [x] Configure server options and metadata
   3. - [x] Implement transport configuration (stdio & SSE)
   4. - [x] Implement basic error handling and logging
   5. - [x] Update package.json with FastMCP dependencies
   6. - [ ] Complete test coverage for both transports

2. - [ ] Resource and Tool Migration (refacto-task-1.2.md)

   1. - [ ] Convert existing endpoints to MCP resources
   2. - [ ] Implement MCP tools for CRUD operations
   3. - [ ] Set up resource templates for rule filtering
   4. - [ ] Integrate existing services with MCP context

3. - [ ] Package and Documentation Update (refacto-task-1.3.md)
   1. - [ ] Update package structure for MCP compatibility
   2. - [ ] Update documentation with MCP integration details
   3. - [ ] Add transport configuration examples
   4. - [ ] Create NPM package release

## Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing rule format
- Must support all current functionality
- Must achieve 80% test coverage minimum
- Must follow MCP protocol specifications
- Must support both stdio and SSE transports

## Dev Notes

Key technical decisions:

- Using FastMCP's decorator API for cleaner code
- Supporting both stdio (default) and SSE transports
- Maintaining existing service layer but adapting it for MCP context
- Keeping current caching strategy but integrating with MCP's resource caching
- Environment variable `MCP_TRANSPORT=sse` to enable SSE mode

## Progress Notes

2024-02-10:

- Completed initial FastMCP server setup
- Implemented dual transport support (stdio & SSE)
- Added comprehensive tests for transport configurations
- Updated package.json dependencies
