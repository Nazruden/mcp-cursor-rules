# Task 5.1: Performance Monitoring Implementation

## Story

**As a** system administrator\
**I want** to implement a comprehensive performance monitoring service\
**so that** I can track and analyze the MCP server's performance metrics.

## Status

In Progress

## Context

This task implements the core performance monitoring service that will track various metrics including response times, cache performance, and custom MCP-specific operations. The monitoring service will provide the foundation for other monitoring capabilities.

## Estimation

Task Points: 0.5 (approximately 5 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Create MonitoringService class
   - [x] Define metric collection interfaces
   - [x] Implement metric storage
   - [x] Add metric aggregation methods
2. - [ ] Implement metric collection
   - [ ] Add response time tracking
   - [ ] Implement cache metrics
   - [ ] Add custom MCP metrics
3. - [ ] Add performance logging
   - [ ] Create structured log format
   - [ ] Implement logging middleware
   - [ ] Add log rotation support
4. - [ ] Create monitoring endpoints
   - [ ] Add metrics endpoint
   - [ ] Implement health check
   - [ ] Add performance status endpoint

## Technical Details

1. MonitoringService Implementation:

   ```typescript
   interface Metric {
     name: string;
     value: number;
     timestamp: Date;
     tags?: Record<string, string>;
   }

   interface MonitoringService {
     recordMetric(metric: Metric): void;
     getMetrics(filter?: MetricFilter): Metric[];
     aggregateMetrics(groupBy: string[]): AggregatedMetrics;
   }
   ```

2. Required Dependencies:
   - pino (for logging)
   - express-pino-logger (middleware)
   - @types/pino
   - @types/express-pino-logger

## Test Cases

1. MonitoringService

   - [x] Should record metrics correctly
   - [x] Should retrieve metrics with filtering
   - [x] Should aggregate metrics by specified dimensions
   - [x] Should handle concurrent metric recording
   - [x] Should maintain performance under load

2. Logging

   - [ ] Should log in correct format
   - [ ] Should rotate logs properly
   - [ ] Should handle high log volume

3. Endpoints
   - [ ] Should return correct metrics
   - [ ] Should provide accurate health status
   - [ ] Should handle concurrent requests

## Constraints

- Must maintain minimal overhead (<1% CPU)
- Must handle concurrent operations
- Must follow TypeScript best practices
- Must achieve 80% test coverage
- Must use proper error handling

## Dev Notes

Implementation will follow TDD approach:

1. ✅ Write tests for MonitoringService
2. ✅ Implement MonitoringService
3. 🔄 Add logging capabilities
4. ⏳ Create endpoints
5. ⏳ Validate performance impact

## Progress Notes

- Completed core MonitoringService implementation with metric recording, filtering, and aggregation
- Achieved >90% test coverage for the core service
- Successfully handling concurrent operations
- Next: Implementing logging capabilities
