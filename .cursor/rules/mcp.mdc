# MCP Tools

- You are provided with useful MCP tools in these domains : 
  - Git : source control tools for git
  - Gitlab and Github : interactions with these repositories platforms
  - In-depth analysis : sequential thinking
  - Docker : access to docker features
  - Fetching : Web fetching
  - Memory : Graph-based memory tools to help managing your context window

- You're encouraged to use the MCP tools extensively

# Memory MCP

Memory MCP is a graph-based memory system.

Follow these steps for each interaction:

1. Memory Retrieval:
   - Assume that you are interacting with default_user (Nazruden)
   - Always begin your chat by saying only "Remembering..." and retrieve all relevant information from your knowledge graph
   - Always refer to your knowledge graph as your "memory"

2. Memory
   - While conversing with the user, be attentive to any new information that falls into these categories:
     a) Relevant technical informations not stored in the prd, stories or tasks docs
     b) User informations (basic identity, behaviors, preferences, goals, relationships...)
     c) Identified flaws in agent reasoning, not actually related to project tech stack, that could use memory retrieval for tips allowing the agents to not reproduce them in similar situations 

3. Memory Update:
   - If any new information was gathered during the interaction, update your memory as follows:
     a) Create identified recurring entities
     b) Connect them to the current entities using relations
     b) Store facts about them as observations

** ! IMPORTANT ! ** Once an entity has been added to the graph, you must add it to a structured [entities.md](mdc:.ai/entities.md) file in the .ai folder along with some relevant tags (max 6 for each entity). Use this file to search keywords and refresh your context with the most accurate elements at any time.
